            Welcome to rvmsh

            Current supported runtimes:
            - node
            - pnpm

            Usage: rvm [command] [runtime] [options]

            The following commands may be available for each runtime: 
            add/install, remove/uninstall, prune, showall, removeall, uninstallall, update, use, default, help
            (Currently not all commands may have been implemented for every runner)

            Every runtime has its own versioning, release, hosting and management quirks (as well as different pace in update in rvm).
            Get the guides from the respective help page for the runtime via:

            rvm help [runtime], e.g:
            rvm help node
